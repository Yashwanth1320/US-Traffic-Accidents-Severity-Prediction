# US-Traffic-Accidents-Severity-Prediction
The United States Department of National Transportation and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has provided a high quality of car-traffic accidents record which documents the initial details of the accidents where the National Transportation and Highway safety officers respond. The main goal of this project is to distribute, expand and ensure the safety concerns of the road trip carried out by various people by identifying the accidents and predicting the probability of accident occurrences all over the country in terms of accident time, cause, and severity with advanced tools in Machine Learning. With this data, we built 4 Machine learning models, compared those models using the performance metrics, and chose the best model for accident severity prediction. As a result, we made a prediction on the severity of traffic accidents that are most likely to occur in the United States.
